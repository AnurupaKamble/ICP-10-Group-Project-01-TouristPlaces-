    </center>In 1891, for example, the women‚Äôs protests forced a backtrack on reforms introduced by the British colonizers that favored external trade over them. In 1939, angered at the British policy of exporting local rice to other parts of India, they confronted the army in what was the Anishuba Nupilan, or Second Women‚Äôs War ‚Äì and won.

    More recently, when the state government announced plans to build a shopping mall on the market‚Äôs site in 2003, they organized weeks-long mass strikes, bringing the economy to a standstill and forcing a reversal. Even now, the women hold regular protests to exert influence, and their input has a serious sway on local elections.
    
    ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge strength of women working here,‚Äù says Thoudam Ongbi Shanti, president of one of the market‚Äôs vendors‚Äô groups. ‚ÄúBut we are not extraordinary people, we just want to make ends meet. We want to be responsible mothers.‚Äù

 Cheiraoba is celebrated on the first day of the Sajibu lunar month, which is usually in April. 
 Cheiraoba is considered one of the most important festivals of Manipur. It is celebrated with great pomp and joy, especially, by the Meiteis of the state. Usually celebrated in the month of April, it marks the beginning of the lunar new year for the Meiteis residing in Manipur and elsewhere.

 While the followers of Sanamahism, Meitei‚Äôs indigenous religion, celebrate it on the first day of the lunar new year, the followers of Vaishnav Hindus, celebrate it on the 13th or 14th of April every year according to the solar Hindu calendar.
 
 On this day, the Meiteis clean their houses and deck up by wearing their fine traditional attires to mark the occasion. Traditional cuisines such as eromba, pakora, ooti, and many more are prepared and offered to the local deity along with colorful flowers and incense sticks in front of the gates. The dishes are also exchanged with the neighbors.
 Shri Shri Govindajee Laishang is a Meitei Hindu temple, dedicated to Hindu deities Radha Krishna (Govindaji). It is the largest Vaishnava temple in Imphal district of Manipur, India. It was originally built in 1846 during the reign of Maharaja Nara Singh and later rebuilt by Maharaja Chandrakriti in 1876.

The sanctum is compartmentalized with two short walls. The outer chamber and the porch are built with huge columns in an arcade system where the walls above the arches rise up to the cornice. The first row of railings is provided above the cornice, in front of the portico roof, over the Pradakshina path. At the four corners of the railings small shrines called "Salas" are built. Above the sanctum, the walls rise to the terrace and are then formed into two arched domes. The arched formation of the dome terminates in to a crown where The daily worship practice followed in the temple, in the morning and evening hours, is very ritualistic and highly disciplined with strict dress code observed by the devotees. The temple doors are opened with the ringing of the large temple bell fixed in a separate bell tower next to the temple, which resounds over a large area. With blowing of ritual conches the main curtained door in front of the sanctum is opened revealing the main images enshrined in the sanctum. Devotees line up on either side of the main shrine, with women queuing up one side and men on the other side. Men who come to offer worship here are to wear only a white shirt or a kurta in a light shade and a dhoti, while women are dressed in traditional Pungou phanek and Innafi, salwar kameez or sari. Women carry offerings to the deity in a brass plate with or without a bell. It is the largest Vaishnav temple in Imphal , situated next to the royal palace.
