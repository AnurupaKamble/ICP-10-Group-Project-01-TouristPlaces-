    <br><b>Pangong Tso</b> is a lake in Leh Ladakh, which derives its name from the Tibetan word, 
    ‚ÄúPangong Tso‚Äù, which means ‚Äúhigh grassland lake‚Äù. <br>The lake is known for its beauty and is famous for changing colors, 
    appearing blue, green and red at different times. <br>Pangong Tso is strategically crucial as it is very close to Chusul Valley, 
    which was one of the battlefronts between India and China during the 1962 war2. 
    <br>China appears to keep India constricted in the region by taking strategic advantage of looking over the Chusul Valley, 
    which it can do if it advances along Pangong Tso.

<u><h1>Best time to visit Pangong Lake:</h1></u>
The most preferred time to visit Pangong is, of course, the summer season i.e. from June to September. 
<u><h1>How to Stay Safe and Healthy:</h1></u>
Altitude sickness is a major health concern when visiting Pangong Lake. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it can affect anyone more than 8,000 feet (2,500 meters) above sea level. 
The thinner air means there's less oxygen to breathe, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the body's blood (hypoxemia) and tissues (hypoxia). 
Symptoms may commonly range from mild headache and fatigue, to the rarer build-up of fluid in the lungs or brain. 
Therefore, acclimatization is to be taken seriously, otherwise you may end up dangerously ill.
<u><h1>Here‚Äôs what you can do!:</h1></u> Get a complete physical check up to make sure you have no serious health issues. If you have a blood pressure problem, do consult your doctor before planning the trip. Rest properly for at least 48 hours. Review the symptoms of mountain sickness so you can recognize and treat them quickly.<br>
