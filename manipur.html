        Manipur is known for its richness in biodiversity including endemic flora and fauna, varied topographic and climatic features, cultural heritage, etc. The abundance in the diversity of the forests and its resources are attributed to the ideal location of the state in the junction of two worldâ€™s hot spots of biodiversity, the India-Myanmar hot spot and the Himalayan hot spot of biological diversity.

The mission of Forest Department, Government of Manipur:
Conserve dense forest cover and increase the density of open forests.
Increase Protected Area Network (PAN) and improve protection network for wildlife conservation.
Encourage sustainable utilization of forest resources, NTFPs, and medicinal plants.
