    <p><b>Information about Rajasthan:</b> Rajasthan, the largest state in India, is located in the northwest and known for its rich cultural heritage and stunning landscapes. It is home to the Thar Desert, while the Aravalli Range adds geographic diversity. The stateâ€™s history is deeply rooted in the valor of the Rajputs, who built many magnificent forts and palaces, like Jaipur's Amber Fort and Udaipur's City Palace.</p>
    <p>Major cities include <u>Jaipur (Pink City), Jodhpur (Blue City), Udaipur (City of Lakes), and Jaisalmer (Golden City)</u>. These cities offer iconic landmarks such as the Hawa Mahal, Mehrangarh Fort, and Jaisalmer Fort. Rajasthan's vibrant culture is reflected in its folk dances like Ghoomar, traditional music, and intricate handicrafts like block printing and blue pottery.</p>
